# Grace Engine

## What is Grace Engine?

This is my new upcoming Engine written in C++ using SFML. It is inspired from my previous (and on going) PiEngine. Grace Engine will allow you to take leverage of the SFML library while being much easier to code with.

## Why not just write in SFML?

You can and no one is stopping you from doing that. The reason for this project is so that you can harness the power of SFML while making your own application easier to read.
Grace Engine abstracts the rendering side of you project and many other aspects too such as collision, audio and more.

## How to get started

Currently Grace Engine does not ship with SFML by default.[^1]\
You will have to follow the download and setup process of SFML using the official [SFML documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php)

## Requirements

SFML: [2.6.2 64-bit](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.2/)\
Compiler version: C++17

> [!NOTE]
> Later revisions of Grace Engine will use newer compiler versions.

[^1]: SFML may be included with future versions of Grace Engine.
